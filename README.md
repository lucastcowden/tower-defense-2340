# Tower Defense Game

I created this project with a team of 5 for a class in school.
We were tasked with producing a tower defense game in Java and JavaFX, with a shop, buyable towers, enemies, etc.

My personal contributions for this project were:
- Creating a monetary system and shop, allowing player to buy towers and make money
- Creating the Enemy classes (including the child classes)
- Creating the Wall-Building Tower
- Creating the Map
- Creating the Tile class, from which all other visual components were formed
- Creating Controller Classes for various game components
- Identifying Code Smells
- Producing UML documentation, duch as Design Class Diagrams and System Sequence Diagrams
- Managing the Github Repository (different from this one)
- Testing Code with JUnits

For this role, I took a lead position, directing meetings and assisting teammates with their portion of the work
when they struggled to conceptualize the overall design. Moreover, working on this project gave me a better understanding
of the AGILE development process, as we not only broke deliverables into milestone sprints, but we also used UML diagrams, 
and SOLID/GRASP principles to design our architecture and plan how various objects would interact with one another.
We also utilized Test Driven Development (TDD) to test our code and make sure it worked properly.

This project taught me a lot about full stack development. Not only did I need to quickly learn the documentation for JavaFX, but almost every class
in this project was created from scratch. This meant I needed to extensively detail what data each class needed to store, what methods were needed to communicate data,
and the overall flow of our project.
